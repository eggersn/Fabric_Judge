How to build
------------
For linux, this should be easy since there's pkg-config support. Please make sure libsodium is installed on your system first.

1. `go get -d github.com/GoKillers/libsodium-go`
2. `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/GoKillers/libsodium-go`
3. `./build.sh`

For Windows, this requires a little more work.

1. Download and install pkg-config for [win32](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/) or [win64](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/dependencies/)
2. Add a system or user variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH pointing to a folder containing pkg-config files, including libsodium
3. `go get -d github.com/GoKillers/libsodium-go`
4. `cd %GOPATH%/src/github.com/GoKillers/libsodium-go`
5. `build.bat`
